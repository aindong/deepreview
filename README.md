## Development üõ†Ô∏è
```
Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepreview.git
cd deepreview
Install dependencies
npm install
Set up environment configuration
cp .env.example .env
```
Add your OpenAI API key to .env:
```
AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Security üîí

- API keys are stored in your system's secure credential storage:
  - macOS: Keychain
  - Windows: Credential Vault
  - Linux: libsecret
- No sensitive data is stored in plain text files
- Uninstalling will automatically remove all credentials

### This implementation:
1. Uses OS-native secure credential storage
2. Doesn't store API keys in plain text
3. Automatically cleans up on uninstall
4. Falls back to .env for development
5. Maintains strict file permissions for any metadata files

The key benefits:
- Credentials are encrypted at rest by the OS
- Other applications can't access the credentials
- No manual file permission management needed
- Automatic cleanup when uninstalling
